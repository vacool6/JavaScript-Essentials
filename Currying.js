// Currying is a concept in functional programming where a function is transformed into a sequence of functions,
// each taking a single argument. The result is a chain of functions, each taking one argument and returning another function, 
// until the final function produces the desired result.

// In JavaScript, currying can be implemented using closures and function chaining.
